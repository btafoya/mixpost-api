## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Laravel Sanctum**: Industry-standard token authentication
- **Token Hashing**: All tokens are hashed in database
- **Token Abilities**: Granular permission control
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable token lifetime
- **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute default (configurable)

### Data Protection

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All production traffic over HTTPS
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation on all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Eloquent ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Output escaping and sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Laravel's built-in CSRF protection

### Network Security

- **IP Whitelisting**: Optional IP-based access restriction
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin policies
- **HTTP Headers**: Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Configuration Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in `.env`
- **Config Validation**: Type checking and validation
- **Secret Rotation**: Token revocation and regeneration
- **Audit Logging**: Track token usage and API calls

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Token Management**
   - Store tokens securely (environment variables, secret managers)
   - Never commit tokens to version control
   - Use different tokens for different environments
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Revoke unused tokens

2. **Access Control**
   - Use token abilities to limit permissions
   - Grant minimum required permissions
   - Review token access regularly
   - Revoke tokens when team members leave

3. **Network Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Enable IP whitelisting if possible
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies
   - Set up rate limiting alerts

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive data in logs
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize all outputs
   - Use prepared statements (Eloquent)
   - Avoid direct SQL queries
   - Keep dependencies updated

2. **Authentication**
   - Never store plain-text passwords
   - Use Laravel's Hash facade
   - Implement proper session management
   - Check token validity on each request

3. **Data Exposure**
   - Use API Resources to control output
   - Hide sensitive fields (tokens, passwords)
   - Sanitize error messages
   - Log security events
